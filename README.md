# simple-facebook
Creating a simple login functionality that takes in a username and password stored in objects and arrays and shows us a newsfeed when in successfully sign in.
WE USE FOR LOOP TO LOOP THROUGH THE DATABASE TO CHECK EACH LOGIN CREDENTIALTO SEE IF IT MATCHES TO WHAT THE USER ENTERS!
SO WE CREATE A FUNCTION AND PASS TWO PARAMETERS USERNAME AND PASSWORD AND WE CHECK IF THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD BOTH MATCH THE USER,
WE LET THEM ACCESS THE NEWSFEED AFTER THEY SUCCESSFULLY SIGN IN!*/
